# Recap of Global Tour of Rust @Shanghai Event

On July 29, 2023, we held the first Global Tour of Rust event at Microsoft Reactor in Shanghai. This article provides a brief overview of the event.

First, let's introduce the event briefly. Global Tour of Rust is a series of sharing events focused on Rust technology, organized by RustCC（*Rust中文社区*） in collaboration with multiple developer communities. The aim is to promote and spread knowledge about Rust among developers both domestically and internationally. Each event may include Meetups, Workshops, and other formats, covering various topics. Through this series, we strive to provide a platform for Rust developers to exchange ideas, share knowledge, experiences, and best practices related to the Rust programming language.

For this conference, we invited three guests: Sui Foundation Ambassador uvd(*Wang Sicheng*), RisingWave Kernel Development Engineer Wen Yiming, and Davi, a senior Rust developer and one of the initiators of the RustyCab community.

The event was kicked off by Leo from the DevBase community, who briefly introduced the event. Then, uvd(*Wang Sicheng*), as the Sui Foundation Ambassador, delivered a keynote speech titled "Asset-Oriented Thinking in Rust." uvd shared thoughts on linking assets with Rust, how to define assets, and Rust ownership.

uvd also introduced Move, a general-purpose asset-oriented smart contract programming language developed by Meta (formerly Facebook). Move is written in Rust and heavily influenced by the Rust language.

The audience showed great interest in the differences and connections between Rust and the Move language.

Next, Wen Yiming gave a presentation on "Rust and RisingWave's Cloud-Native Storage Engine." He introduced the data model and storage abstraction in the stream processing scenarios of RisingWave, the self-developed cloud-native storage engine Hummock, and the Rust development practices involved in Hummock.

The audience actively raised specific questions related to the presentation.

Afterward, with the support of the OpenBuild community, we provided a delightful tea break for the attendees.

After the tea break, Davi, a senior Rust developer and one of the initiators of the RustyCab community, delivered a speech titled "From 0 to 1: Challenges and Opportunities of Rust in Web Development." He shared his experiences and insights in developing on the Axum Web framework.

Finally, Leo from DevBase hosted a roundtable session, where the three guests patiently discussed their experiences and challenges while learning Rust, responding to questions from the audience.

During the roundtable, uvd(*Wang Sicheng*) mentioned his experience in learning Rust, suggesting starting with basic syntax, writing code and small applications, and then returning to advanced syntax, which provided valuable insights for the audience.

Finally, when the event concluded, we took a group photo to commemorate the occasion!

Through organizing the Global Tour of Rust, we hope to build a thriving Rust developer community in China and promote learning, collaboration, and innovation. We welcome developers of all skill levels, from beginners to experienced professionals, to join us in exploring the world of Rust and its ever-evolving ecosystem.
