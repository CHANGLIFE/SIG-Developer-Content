## Introduction
OpenBuild is an open-source Web3 developer community. Our mission is to help Web2 developers better transition into Web3, as long as the content aligns with this mission. 
Everyone is allowed to submit tasks, and interested volunteers can claim these tasks.

## Task Process
* Open Propose: All tasks can be proposed openly. After discussion and approval in the community, they become a Task.
* Task: A task has a clear job description, workload, and reward amount. Tasks are divided into three stages (using 3 different Issue labels):
  * To be claimed: Volunteers can claim based on their interests and time schedule.
  * In progress: Volunteers should complete the task according to the time requirements, otherwise, it may affect the distribution of rewards.
  * Completed: According to the task requirements, submit a PR (if any). After the PR is merged, the task is completed.

Rewards are settled on a monthly basis. After the settlement is complete, the task is labeled as "Settled".
> We ask all volunteers first to complete their information in the [Volunteer Form](https://www.notion.so/openbuild/9dd3778c1c9a44c686d36ef1b067ff19?v=790d75de4aa041a59d3fc6814bd2d041&pvs=4).

## How to Publish a Task
Any user can submit an **Open Propose** Issue on the [Issue Page](https://github.com/openbuildxyz/web3-content/issues). 
The Open Propose describes what the task will do and the approximate workload. 
The community will discuss the Open Propose. If it aligns with the mission and is helpful to the community, the Open Propose will be converted into a Task.
